# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

> [Project Euler Problem Statement](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

## Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:

$$
1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 8,\ 13,\ 21,\ 34,\ 55,\ 89,\ \dots
$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Plan & Approach

**Analysis:**
- Use a generator to compute Fibonacci terms up to the limit.
- Use a helper function to check if a term is even.
- Sum even terms only.

**Edge Cases:**
- Limit < 2
- No even Fibonacci below given limit

## Running the Code

```commandline
python solution_002.py # solves for default limit (4,000,000)
pytest test_solution_002.py # runs all tests
```

## Final Answer

- The final answer for limit=4,000,000 is: **4613732**
