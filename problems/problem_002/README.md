## 🔍 Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:

$$
1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 8,\ 13,\ 21,\ 34,\ 55,\ 89,\ \dots
$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed **four million**, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## 💡 My Approach

To solve this problem:

1. **Generate the Fibonacci sequence** iteratively, starting with the terms $1$ and $2$ as specified.
2. For each term in the sequence:
   - Check if it is **even** (i.e., divisible by 2).
   - If so, add it to a running total.
3. Stop when the next term exceeds **4,000,000**.
4. Return the accumulated sum.

This approach avoids recursion for efficiency and uses constant space, making it both time- and memory-efficient.

### Key Insight:
- Every third Fibonacci number is even in this sequence (pattern: odd → even → odd → even...), but checking divisibility directly keeps the logic clear and correct.

## ✅ Final Answer

The sum of all even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding four million is:

4613732

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests are implemented using `pytest` to verify correctness:
- The `solve()` function is tested against the known correct result.
- Ensures robustness during future refactoring.

To run the tests:
```bash
pytest test_solution.py -v
```
